Motivation:

I love pushbullet to save links to stuff I find while browsing on phone.

I then got tired of copy pasting my links from pushbullet to my org-mode notes.

Loop over my pushbullet items and write them to org mode format.

+ backup items to ~/Library/Application Support/cloverback/keys.db
+ expire the backup after 1d
+ delete items from pushbullet
