I love using pushbullet in order to save links to stuff I find while browsing on phone.

I then got tired of copy pasting my links from pushbullet history https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings/history to my org-mode notes.

This project loop over my pushbullet items and write them to org mode format for me to squirell them away into my notes file.

+ copy org-mode snippet to clipboard
+ backup items to ~/Library/Application Support/cloverback/keys.db
+ expire the backup after 1d
+ delete items from pushbullet
